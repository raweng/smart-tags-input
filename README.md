# Smart Tags Input Plugin

‘Smart Tags Input’ is a JavaScript plugin that allows you to easily turn any text input (entered within double curly braces) into ‘smart tags’. This helps you differentiate normal text from the text that you want to highlight. 

# Features 

Quick delete: Once normal text is converted to smart tags, you can delete the entire tag with one press of ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ keys. 

Edit text: Clicking on this smart tag makes it editable, unlike most tags. You can then edit the text present within the curly braces, and convert it back to smart tags instantly. 

#Installation

Add script tag with the plugin file in our html <head> tag

```html
<script src="js/smart-tags-input.js"></script>
```

We need to initialize the plugin in the local JavaScript file.

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
	var tagInput = new SmartTagsInput("testTagInput");
	tagInput.init();
}, false);
```
